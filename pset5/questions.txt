0. How many different colors does each format support?

    - JPEG, PNG, and BMP support 24 bits per pixel. 8 each for red, green, and blue. This gives it 16 million 
      color possibilites.

    - GIF supports 256 colors. 
     
1. Which of these formats supports animation?

    - GIF supports animation.

2. What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?

    - Lossless doesn't lose any quality lossy does.

3. Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?

    - BMP

4. What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
    
    - It is not referenced in the system. However the data is still there. It is kind of like a pointer and 
    its pointee. The pointer gets deleted but the pointee is still there.
     
5. What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?

    - Use sanitazation software or overwrite every block with NULL characters.
    
6. What’s stdint.h?

    - It's a header file that declares sets of integers and how many bytes they take up.
    
7. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

    - You always know how many bytes you're using.


8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? 
    (Assume a 32-bit architecture like the CS50 Appliance.)
    
    BYTE = 8
    DWORD = 32
    LONG = 32
    WORD = 16
    
9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
    
    ASCII = BM, decimal = 66 and 67, hexadecimal = 42 and 4D

10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

    - bfSize is part of BITMAPFILEHEADER struct which deals with the type, size, and layout of the file.
    biSize is part of BITMAPINFOHEADER struct which deals with the color and dimensions of the file.

11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

    - The infile is an unsupported file format.

12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

    - biBitCount

13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?

    - It's not the correct file format.

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

    - Because it is the one and only element.
    
15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

    - It needs to be a multiple of 4.

16. What does fseek do?

    - It searches for padding.
    
17. What is SEEK_CUR?

    - The current position of the file pointer.

18. Whodunit?

    - Milo Banana dun it.
